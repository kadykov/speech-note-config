# Speech Note Custom Models

This repository contains a custom `models.json` configuration file for the [Speech Note](https://github.com/mkiol/dsnote) application.

## Motivation

The default models provided with Speech Note use `q5_0` quantization (5-bit quantization). On some hardware configurations, this aggressive quantization may not provide significant performance benefits over higher-precision models like 16-bit floating-point (`FP16`) or 8-bit quantization (`q8_0`), while potentially reducing accuracy.

This repository provides a configuration that includes `FP16` and `q8_0` variants of WhisperCpp models, allowing users to choose the precision level that works best for their specific hardware and accuracy requirements.

## Contents

This repository contains a `models.json` file that adds the following WhisperCpp model variants to Speech Note:

- **FP16 variants** (16-bit floating-point):
  - English: Small, Medium, Distil Medium, Distil Large-v3.5, Large-v3, Large-v3 Turbo
  - Multilingual (Large-v3, Large-v3 Turbo) - also available for Russian and French
  
- **q8_0 variants** (8-bit quantization):
  - English: Medium

## How to Use

To use the custom models defined in this repository, you need to replace the `models.json` file in your Speech Note configuration directory with the one from this repository.

1.  Clone this repository or download the `models.json` file.
2.  Locate the Speech Note data directory on your system.
    *   It is typically at `~/.local/share/net.mkiol/dsnote/`.
    *   For Flatpak at `~/.var/app/net.mkiol.SpeechNote/data/net.mkiol/dsnote/`.
3.  Backup your existing `models.json` file.
4.  Copy the `models.json` file from this repository to the Speech Note data directory.
5.  Restart Speech Note.

The new models should now be available in the model selection menu.
